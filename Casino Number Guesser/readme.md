Casino Number Guesser is a simple game where you try and guess the right number for the amount of virtual money you invested. You get 10 times the amount you 
invested in the first place. You can either quit the game voluntarily, even if you have enough money to continue, or, if you don't have enough money, you will be
kicked/forbidden to continue playing.
